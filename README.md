## Hi! I am Florian - Nice to meet you 👋

:computer: I’m currently developing scalable workflows and tools to analyze and process spatial omics and single-cell multi-omics data. Have a look, for example, at [nf-core/spatialxe](https://nf-co.re/spatialxe/dev/).

# :seedling: I’m also exploring:
- Deep learning methods for artifact detection
- GPU-accelerated data processing

# :mortar_board: Scientific Interests:
- Image-based spatial transcriptomics
 - Artefact detection
 - Quality control
 - Noise estimation
 - Standard data processing
- Bioinformatics pipelining
 - Nextflow, Galaxy, Snakemake
 - Scaling
 - Deploying workflows
 - resource and parameter optimization
- Single cell multiomics
 - Standardized data processing
 - Demultiplexing
 - Quality control
 - Artefact detection
