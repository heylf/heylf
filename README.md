## Hi! I am Florian - Nice to meet you 👋

💻 I’m currently developing scalable workflows and tools to analyze and process spatial omics and single-cell multi-omics data. Have a look, for example, at [nf-core/spatialxe](https://nf-co.re/spatialxe/dev/).

🌱 I’m also exploring:
- Deep learning methods for artifact detection
- GPU-accelerated data processing

💬 Ask me about:
- Bioinformatics pipelining, scaling, deploying workflows, and codebase optimization
- Quality control for spatial omics technologies
- Standardized data processing for (multiplexed) single-cell multi-omics and image-based spatial omics data
