## Hi! I am Florian - Nice to meet you 👋

:computer: I’m currently developing scalable workflows and tools to analyze and process spatial omics and single-cell multi-omics data.

## :fire: Key Projects

### Tools
- A tool to evaluate and classify predicted peak profiles to assess the binding specificity of a protein to its targets: [StoatyDive](https://github.com/heylf/StoatyDive)

### Workflows
- Nextlfow Xenium data processing pipeline: [nf-core/spatialxe](https://nf-co.re/spatialxe/dev/)

### Other Projects that I am supporting

- A standardized Nextflow pipeline for benchmarking variant-calling workflows, enabling reproducible and FAIR analysis: [nf-core/variantbenchmarking](https://github.com/nf-core/variantbenchmarking)

## :mortar_board: Scientific Interests:
- Image-based spatial transcriptomics
  - Artefact detection
  - Quality control
  - Noise estimation
  - Standard data processing
- Single cell multiomics
  - Standardized data processing
  - Demultiplexing
  - Quality control
  - Artefact detection
- Bioinformatics pipelining
  - Nextflow, Galaxy, Snakemake
  - Scaling
  - Deploying workflows
  - resource and parameter optimization

## :seedling: I’m also exploring:
- Deep learning methods for artifact detection
- GPU-accelerated data processing
